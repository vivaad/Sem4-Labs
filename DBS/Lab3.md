---

## Set Comparison

### 9. Find names of instructors with salary greater than that of some (at least one) instructor in the Biology department

select name from instructor 
where salary > some (select salary from instructor where dept_name = 'Biology');
```

---

### 10. Find names of all instructors whose salary is greater than the salary of all instructors in the Biology department

```

---

### 11. Find the departments that have the highest average salary

```sql
-- Find departments with the highest average salary
select dept_name, avg(salary) 
from instructor 
group by dept_name 
having avg(salary) >= all (select avg(salary) from instructor group by dept_name);
```

---

### 12. Find the names of those departments whose budget is lesser than the average salary of all instructors

       and C.dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.' 
       and T.id = S.id) >= 2;
```

---

## Subqueries in the From Clause
